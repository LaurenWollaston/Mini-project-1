        <p class="dot">     "Despite the enormous hyperbole surrounding the Web, current reality is that almost nobody takes it seriously as a business tool. Even though the December 1996 holiday shopping season was the first in which a few merchants reaped significant sales from the Web it is still almost impossible to actually get to buy anything on the Web: one journalist who set out to do all his Christmas shopping on the Web only succeeded in acquiring a single present. The problem is that most companies view their websites as glorified brochures and not as a way of interacting with their customers. The goal of having a website should not be to brag to your friends that you are on the Web but to provide service to your customers (and thus make money)." <br><span class="quote">-Jakob Nielsen, <i>Nielsen Norman Group</i>, Dec 31, 1996</i></span></p>
